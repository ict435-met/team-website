<h2 style="text-align:left;">Report for week of 6/5 through 6/12</h2>
                                    
                                    
                                           <p>Shortly after working on our team website Brian Campbell requested web space from NMSU ICT to host our project.  Brian also created a GitHub code repository for the group, so that we could work on the project site using version control, this will help us to maintain a full project history.  Brian then created an Asana project, to help us with project management. </p>
                                           
                                <p><strong>June 7th:</strong><br>Aaron Wood, Rockson Opoku, and Felipe Parra met from 7:00 PM for about 15 minutes to make introductions and test our computers for the adobe connect system.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>June 8th:</strong><br>The entire team was able to meet with Professor Kelly at 7:00 PM for approximately 30 minutes to get an overview of the project and its initial requirements.  We have been tasked with the creation of an ABET Engineering Technology Accreditation webpage.  This website could be used by accreditors to review the department of Mechanical Engineering Technology. It will serve as a web directory with all of their required documentation.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>June 9th:</strong><br>We received notification that the web hosting was configured by ICT.   Our site will be found at <a href = "https://ict435-met.nmsu.edu">https://ict435-met.nmsu.edu </a> We now have everything needed for a successful project along with a general outline of the project. </p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Next meeting:</strong><br>Is scheduled for June 15th at 7:00 MST and we will use this time to start deciding on the design, assignment of tasks, and making some initial decisions that will likely affect the look and underlying technology used on the website.</p>
